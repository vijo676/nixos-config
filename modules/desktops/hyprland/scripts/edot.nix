# EDot - Edit Dotfiles
# Normally, apps such as Hyprland will immediatly reflect changes to its config.
# When using Nix to manage the config without impure methods, the file will be readonly.
# This script allows making live updates to the readonly dotfiles by temporarily substituting the file.
# Upon exiting the editor, the changes will be printed as a diff, which can then manually be applied to your Nix config.
